# RoleManagement
I use main class in RoleManagement.java to run the project
Input data same as requirement, no need to case sensitive.
To veiry output, please type "output"

about the complexity, the main method need to verify here is processOutput(). I put all data into a tree to easy for travesal.
and when travel, because we have to visit all node in tree(recursively or iteratively),That means that I’ll get a runtime complexity of 𝑂(𝑛) - where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
